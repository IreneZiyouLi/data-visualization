# Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data
This is my public portflio for telling stories with data (94870) at CMU!

# About me
- I am a graduate student at CMU majoring Business Intelligence and Data Analytics and graduating December 2022.
- I have professional experiences using Tableau for dashboarding and visualizations, but have struggled to make the most effective visualizations based on the use case many times. 

# What I hope to learn
- I wish I could boarden my data visualization tools and inventories.
- I wish I could learn to identify the most suitable visualizations that meet (or exceed) user' expectation efficiently (especially under time pressure)
- I wish I could understand the use of colors and shapes in graphs better!
