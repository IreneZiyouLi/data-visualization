# Final Project : Part 1
## Section 1: Outline of the Project

### Summary
The nutrition intake outlook of people in the U.S. : the trend overtime, the demographic difference and distribution in terms of dietary preference, the evaluation on the popular typical American daily meals, and the corresponding obesity rate. The main purpose of this project is to convince people the importance of eatting healthy and provide actionable recommendations through stories and data viusalizations. 

### Project Structure
- I would start the story with the visualization of the comparison between the mean daily Calories intake of American and the Calories intake recommended by FDA (broken down by Macronutrients (Carbohydrates, fat, and protein). I assume that would keep the audience's interest to continue read the article as they will be curious about the details. 
- Then I would list out the most popular foods in the U.S. (breakdown by categories including regular meals, snacks, and sweets, etc) with their calories/nutrition highlights. 
- So far I've been focused on the nutrients related to the food, then I will move the "People" side of the story: how the nutrition outlook is according to demographic partitions (gender, age, geographic/state, salary level), which I will draw some meaningful conclusions on who are the people that should be cared about more about their dietary intake, and then deep dive into several important factors. 
- The deep dive would include: proverty related to obesity, unhealthy dietary preference of teenagers that lead to some concerns on obesity and diabetes. 
- In the end, I would provide recommendations on dietary guidelines, and call on public policy makers' action as well.
