# user research protocol
My project focuses on telling the story about how unhealthy food choices available in the U.S. right now, and how people's eating habits detour from recommended health guide both actively and passively.
### the target audience of the story
- Primary audience: the general public in the U.S., specifically those "frequent customers" of fast food brands, who are identified as overweight/obesity.
- Secondary audience: resturant owner/food providers and related stakeholders who can potentially change the landscape of food industry (even make a little difference).
- Additional audience (I wish to reach out): policy makers who can enforce regulation on school lunch supply, resturant nutrition enclosement and anything could help guid people eat healthier.

### approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Since I would target all the people in the U.S., my approach is a comparatively general than that would be used for niche topics. <br/>
I planned to interview one friend who I know having a bad eating habits and is less awared about food nutrition than a typical American.   
Additional representative individuals were expected to be those who visit the McDonalds on Forbes Ave in Pittsburgh on my interview day.
To keep the interview responses balance, I targeted to interview one individual who has above-average awareness on food health, and actively exercise on a weekly basis as well. 
### Interview Script & pre-determined interview questions
- Brief introduction:
"I am working on a project that aim to tell the facts about the landscape of current eating habits within the U.S. and would like to hear your feedback on it. Any honest opinion is welcomed. It would only take less than 5 minute."

1. How often do you eat fast food per week? 
2. Do you consider yourself having a healthy lifestyle, speicifically regarding your food preference?
- Post storyboards walkthrough:
1. what impress you the most from the storyboards, or what you would summarize in one sentence?
2. What is unclear to you? and what information you would like to explore more?
3. Are you motiviated to change your behaviors, even a little bit?

### the findings from interviews

- Positives:
1. the langauge used is easily to understand (precieved by all 3 interviewees)
2. the visualization is not confusing (but not fancy as well)
