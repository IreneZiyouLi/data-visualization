# Part III: Final data story
## Section 1: change being made from Part II
#### 1. Narrow down to "eating habits" and nutrition factors related to health:
- In part 2, I included information related to the calories burned by different physical activties. The initial purpose was to inform the audience way to burn out the calories they might help to conteract the calories gained from unhealthy food. However, I found it hard to be integrated it to the story without bringing up a larger topic and distract the audience.
- Therefore, I choose to go in details on nutrition information, how it would influence our health, and deep dive into help macronutrient different from each other. That would be more aligned with the call to actions as well
### 2. changes to Call to Action
- This change was due to the re-define (also narrow down) audiences. In part 2, I aimed to target the general public in the U.S. as I believe American in general lack of education on how to eat healthy (or doesn't take it serious). Thefore, I also include the recommendations to the policymaker to provide more healtier lunch options to school etc. However, after critiques and user research, I think I should narrow down to something that people can act on immediately, before they totally forget this story. Eventually, I changed it to ask people focus on eating healthy etc.
### 3. In terms of visualization
- In order to make corresponding adjustment mentioned above, I made two comparable pie charts to compare the difference between healthy vs unhealthy macronutrient compositions.
