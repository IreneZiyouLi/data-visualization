# user research protocol
My project focuses on telling the story about how unhealthy food choices available in the U.S. right now, and how people's eating habits detour from recommended health guide both actively and passively.
### the target audience of the story
- Primary audience: the general public in the U.S., specifically those "frequent customers" of fast food brands, who are identified as overweight/obesity.
- Secondary audience: resturant owner/food providers and related stakeholders who can potentially change the landscape of food industry (even make a little difference).
- Additional audience (I wish to reach out): policy makers who can enforce regulation on school lunch supply, resturant nutrition enclosement and anything could help guid people eat healthier.
