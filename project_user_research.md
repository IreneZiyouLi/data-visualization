# user research protocol
My project focuses on telling the story about how unhealthy food choices available in the U.S. right now, and how people's eating habits detour from recommended health guide both actively and passively.
### the target audience of the story
- Primary audience: the general public in the U.S., specifically those "frequent customers" of fast food brands, who are identified as overweight/obesity.
- Secondary audience: resturant owner/food providers and related stakeholders who can potentially change the landscape of food industry (even make a little difference).
- Additional audience (I wish to reach out): policy makers who can enforce regulation on school lunch supply, resturant nutrition enclosement and anything could help guid people eat healthier.

### approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Since I would target all the people in the U.S., my approach is a comparatively general than that would be used for niche topics. <br/>
I planned to interview one friend who I know having a bad eating habits and is less awared about food nutrition than a typical American.   
Additional representative individuals were expected to be those who visit the McDonalds on Forbes Ave in Pittsburgh on my interview day.

### pre-determined interview questions
- Before storyboards walkthrough
1. How often do you eat fast food per week? 
2. Do you consider yourself having a healthy lifestyle, speicifically regarding your food preference?
